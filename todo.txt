   TO DO

   how to add security to api controller? Need to allow for Default Action.async to be overridden with X.async

    another example test project.
        2 tables
        1 user -> user_id, user_name and user_password
        2 blog -> blog_id , user_id , blog_created , blog_text

        login as user
        blog as user
        curl for admin



for every api generate Action class and a trait
module bind trait to a class.
                # default to play.api.mvc.Action
                api_Inject = "controllers.SecuredAction"
                #default to Action
                action = "securedAction.Action"
